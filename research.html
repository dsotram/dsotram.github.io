<h2> Jellyfish as Probes of the Cosmic Gas </h2>
<p>
In standard models of galaxy formation and evolution, there remains open-ended but highly connected questions: how does a galaxy sustain its star formation, given its limited gas mass (i.e., the fuel to form stars); how does a galaxy quench its star formation and remain quiescent for the rest of its life. These questions address the prevalence of two observationally dominant types of galaxies -- blue and star-forming, red and dead -- but how does one journey through the green valley between these two peaks? One such avenue involves the rich interplay of gas, stars, and dust between galaxies, their halos, and extragalactic space, coined the cosmic baryon cycle. Specifically, we study how smaller, satellite galaxies evolve as they enter the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of more massive hosts. Using the unparalleled resolution and sample size from the IllustrisTNG simulations, an observationally rare type of galaxy has emerged, and emerged often but only for short periods of time. These objects hurtle through the ambient, hot CGM at supersonic speeds, creating bow shocks at their fronts and long tails of stripped cold gas in their wakes. These "jellyfish" galaxies could be the missing link between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while also affecting their more massive host's ability to sustain or quench its own star formation. Hence the title of this thesis: Jellyfish Galaxies as Probes of the Cosmic Gas.

The first project involves characterizing the cold gas in the CGM and predicting as a function of host halo mass how much cold gas satellite galaxies bring into the CGM throughout cosmic time. After this demographic study we will focus on individual objects, examining where the ram pressure and tidal stripping occur and the lives of these cold gas clouds once they are no longer bound to the satellite. This may involve running zoom-in simulations of the jellyfish galaxies themselves, which would be the first such simulations of this kind. Lastly, we will connect our findings to observations by, e.g., creating synthetic observations and predicting what future telescopes and surveys may detect.

<h2> The Galaxy-Halo Size Relation in FIREbox </h2>
<p>
Galaxy sizes correlate closely with the sizes of their parent dark matter haloes, suggesting a link between halo formation and galaxy growth. However, the precise nature of this relation and its scatter remains to be understood fully, especially for low-mass galaxies. We analyse the galaxy-halo size relation for low-mass (Mstar~10^(7−9) Msun) central galaxies over the past 12.5 billion years with the help of cosmological volume simulations (FIREbox) from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project. We find a nearly linear relationship between the half-stellar mass galaxy size R1/2 and the parent dark matter halo virial radius Rvir. This relation evolves only weakly since redshift z=5: R1/2kpc=(0.053+/-0.002)(Rvir/35kpc)^(0.934+/-0.054), with a nearly constant scatter =0.084 dex. Whilst this ratio is similar to what is expected from models where galaxy disc sizes are set by halo angular momentum, the low-mass galaxies in our sample are not angular momentum supported, with stellar rotational to circular velocity ratios vrot/vcirc~0.15. Introducing redshift as another parameter to the GHSR does not decrease the scatter. Furthermore, this scatter does not correlate with any of the halo properties we investigate — including spin and concentration — suggesting that baryonic processes and feedback physics are instead critical in setting the scatter in the galaxy-halo size relation. Given the relatively small scatter and the weak dependence of the galaxy-halo size relation on redshift and halo properties for these low-mass central galaxies, we propose using galaxy sizes as an independent method from stellar masses to infer halo masses.</p>

  suggest to extent BLR radius measurements to higher redshifts by applying the method of spectroastrometry to AGN.
  This technique has been used in studies of protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects and theory predicts that
  this technique is capable of directly measuring black hole masses of high-luminosity and high-redshift quasars.
  Therefore, we now study the application of this method to AGN BLRs with data obtained with the echelle spectrograph
  Gemini/GNIRS.

<h2 id="SOWAT"> Speckle Holography of dense stellar systems</h2>
<h4>SOWAT: Speckle Observations with Alleviated Turbulence</h4>
<p>
  Adaptive optics (AO) systems and image reconstruction algorithms are indispensable tools when it comes to high-resolution astrometry, especially when observations at the resolution limit of the telescope are desired.
  In this project, we analyze the potential of combining both techniques, i.e. by applying image reconstruction on AO corrected short exposures.
  For this purpose, we simulate speckle clouds with and without AO corrections in the end-to-end AO simulation tool <a href="http://frigaut.github.io/yao/index.html" target="_blank">YAO</a> (Rigaut & van Dam, 2013) and create synthetic observations, including all relevant noise contributions, using the PYTHON package <a href="https://github.com/felixbosco/vegapy" target="_blank">VEGAPy</a>.
  We reconstruct the object with the holographic imaging algorithm <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429.1367S/abstract" target="_blank">(Schödel et al. 2012, 2013)</a> to the obtained observations and find that using (partial) AO corrections enables the use of fainter holography reference stars and/or longer integration times.
  Both extent the applicability of the speckle imaging technique, fainter reference stars enable studying fainter fields and longer integration times enable the use of slower detectors.
  The results are published in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131d4502B/abstract">F. Bosco, J-U. Pott & R. Schödel (2019), PASP, 131, 998</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we work on implementing a corresponding observing mode at the large binocular telescope (LBT, Arizona, USA),
  using the NIR imager LBT/LUCI with a new detector readout scheme.
  Furthermore, we are about to develop an integrated reduction and analysis software suite that is capable of reducing
  corresponding data and reconstructing the image with speckle holography.

<h2> High-mass star formation </h2>
<p>
  The Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) large program
  <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/core/CORE/Overview.html" target="_blank">CORE</a> addresses open questions
  on the processes clump fragmentation and disk formation during formation of high-mass stars (> 8 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>).
  As part of the survey on twenty high-mass star-forming regions, I analyzed the star forming region IRAS 23033+5951 (or G110.0931-00.0641)
  for clump fragmentation, circumprotostellar rotation and molecular outflows.
</p>
<p>
  The observational data are from NOEMA in three configurations and the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope at 220 GHz,
  probing the gas and dust emission at an angular resolution of ~0.44", corresponding to 1900 AU. In the mm continuum
  emission, we identify a protostellar cluster with at least 9 mm-sources,
  where three of them show a significantly higher luminosity above a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 in the uniform weighted images.
  Two of these are embedded in rotating structures and drive molecular outflows, traced in <sup>13</sup>CO (2&mdash;1) emission.
  The velocity profiles across the cores are similar to Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center of rotation.
  Position-velocity diagrams suggest protostellar masses of ~ 9 and 20 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>.
</p>
<p>
  Rotation temperatures from fitting CH3CN (12<sub>k</sub>&mdash;11<sub>k</sub>) spectra are used for estimating the gas temperature
  and by that the disk stability against gravitational fragmentation, utilizing the Toomre Q parameter.
  Considering different disk inclination angles, we do not identify either candidate disk to be significantly unstable
  against an axisymmetric gravitational collapse.
  The three dominant sources cover different evolutionary stages within the same maternal gas clump.
  The rotational and outflow properties of the cores are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions
