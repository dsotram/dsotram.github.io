<h2 id="MWM31"> Milky Way and M31 analogues: insights from the cosmological simulation TNG50 </h2>
<h4>Doctoral Thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy with Annalisa Pillepich </h4>
<p>
  In my PhD thesis I studied key facets of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxiesâ€™ formation, evolution, and structure in the cosmological context provided by the unparalleled resolution and sample size from the state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, hightest resolution run from the IllustrisTNG suite. This simulation allows for the identification of a large number (around 200) of MW/M31-like galaxies at high resolution. Until now, studies of this type of galaxies had been carried out using zoom-in simulations that reproduced only a few analogs (at most, around a dozen).

  In this way, it was possible to shed new light on problems studied in recent years concerning the formation and evolution of the MW and M31:

    <ul>
      <li>The impact of recent major mergers on galaxy stellar disks, discovering that many of these galaxies may have experienced a recent merger and can still form a disk up to z=0.</li>
      <li>The diversity and variety of manifestations of stellar disk flaring, where it was possible to reproduce the different types and values observed in previous studies and recent observations, now under a single theoretical model of galaxy formation.</li>
      <li>The presence of very metal-poor stars in the stellar disks and other morphological components, reinforcing the idea that the halo is not necessarily the component containing the oldest stars of the MW. This finding holds extraordinary relevance in the current era of highly detailed Galactic surveys.</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>On the likelihoods of finding very metal-poor (and old) stars in the Milky Way's disc, bulge, and halo</h3>
<p>
  Recent observational studies have uncovered a small number of very metal-poor (${\mathrm [Fe/H]} < -2$) stars with cold kinematics in the Galactic disc and bulge. However, their origins remain enigmatic. We select a total of 138 Milky Way (MW) analogs from the  TNG50 cosmological simulation based on their $z=0$ properties: disky morphology, stellar mass, and local environment. In order to make more predictive statements for the MW, we further limit the spatial volume coverage of stellar populations in galaxies to that targeted by the upcoming 4MOST high-resolution survey of the Galactic disc and bulge. We find that across all galaxies, $\sim$20 per cent of very metal-poor stars belong to the disk, with some analogs reaching 30 per cent. About 50$\pm$10 per cent of the VMP disc stars are, on average, older than 12.5 Gyr and $\sim$70$\pm$10 per cent come from accreted satellites. A large fraction of the VMP stars belong to the halo ($\sim$70) and have a median age of 12 Gyr. Our results with the TNG50 cosmological simulation confirm earlier findings with simulations of fewer individual galaxies, and suggest that the stellar disc of the Milky Way is very likely to host significant amounts of very- and extremely-metal-poor stars that, although mostly of ex situ origin, can also form in situ, reinforcing the idea of the existence of a primordial Galactic disc.

<h3>TNG-Cluster First Results: The CGM of Massive Satellites</h3>
<p>
  I was part of the TNG-Cluster first results team, and we recently released most of our first results papers on arXiv! TNG-Cluster is a collection of 352 zoom-in magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters. The clusters that were the targets of this project are some of the most massive galaxy clusters, some of the most massive virialized objects in the universe. The combination of sample size with competetive baryonic mass and spatial resolution, coupled with the well-validated TNG galaxy formation model, opens new avenues to statistically study galaxy clusters, their intercluster media, and their satellite galaxies. Check out the <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/cluster/" target="_blank">TNG-Cluster website</a> for the other first results papers. We plan to publicly release the simulation output in 2024, but if you are interested in using the data now, we are happy to collaborate!
</p>
<p>
  For the TNG-Cluster first results paper, I focused on roughly 90,000 satellite member galaxies of the galaxy clusters. Specifically, I followed the evolution of these satellites from when their birth as central galaxies, through their infall, all the way until \(z=0\) today. I examined how both internal -- namely feedback from their supermassive black holes -- and external -- namely ram pressure -- processes affect both the interstellar and circumgalactic media (ISM/CGM) reservoirs. I found over 5,000 massive satellites that retain their own CGM, despite living in harsh cluster environments, and speculate that these CGM should have observational signatures in, for example, the soft X-ray. This work is published as <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024A%26A...686A..86R/abstract" target="_blank">Rohr et al. (2024)</a>, and has been presented at A Journey Through Galactic Environments (Porto Ercole, Italy) and Building Galaxies from Scratch (Vienna, Austria) conferences.

<h3>Cosmological Jellyfish Project</h3>
<p>
  My first project invovled quantitifying when, where, and for how long ram pressure stripping -- the process that forms the jellyfish tails -- acts on TNG jellyfish galaxies. This was part of the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/apillepich/cosmological-jellyfish" target="_blank">Cosmological Jellyfish Project</a>, where we showed images of satellite galaxies from the TNG50 and TNG100 simulations to trained citizen scientists, asking them to answer one question: Do you think that the galaxy at the center looks like a jellyfish? Based on these answers, we have published three papers forming the Jellyfish galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations series. We <a href="https://www.tng-project.org/data/docs/specifications/#sec5_3" target="_blank">publicly released</a>the results from this project and are happy to collaborate! For my paper, I developed a tracer particle scheme to track the gas from the interstella media (ISM) to the jellyfial tails and beyond. After confirming that ram pressure stripping was the primary cause of jellyfish gas loss, I showed that jellyfish galaxies, and satellites in general, deposit more cold gas into halos than exist in them today. I've presented the results as a poster at the virtual Galaxy Clusters conference hosted by the Space Telescope Science Institute and as full talks at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/cam.ac.uk/quenching/programme#h.ohkoyw4ilbje" target="_blank">Epoch of Galaxy Quenching</a> (Cambridge, UK), <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1x4FNVCmUWTFwznOAs9RYhLwkKl-kmhZT/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=110435217712956675242&rtpof=true" target="_blank">What Matter(s) around Galaxies</a> (Champuloc, Italy), and A Journey Through Galactic Environments (Porto Ercole, Italy) conferences.

<h2 id="GHSR"> The Galaxy-Halo Size Relation in FIREbox </h2>

  I spent the summer of 2018 working with Robert Feldmann and his group at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, courtesy of the ThinkSwiss research program. While there and afterwards, I studied the relationship between the sizes of low mass galaxies (M* ~ 10^7-9 Msun) measured by their stars and their halos measured by their dark matter. In the attached plot of low mass galaxies since z=5 in FIREbox, we see that the population at a given redshift has an apprxomiately linear relationship between galaxy stellar size R_1/2 and dark matter halo virial radius R_vir. However, across the populations at different redshifts, the relationship is sub-linear with power-law index alpha ~ 0.9. We found that the halo spin and its concentration, the former a proxy for its formation time, do not reduce the scatter in this galaxy-halo size relation (GHSR), contrary to some classical theories of galaxy formation. However, for these same galaxies, the halo spin and concentration are significant in setting the normalization of the stellar-halo mass relation (SHMR). This suggests for this sample of galaxies that the GHSR is just as or perhaps more fundamental than the SHMR. I presented these results at the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AAS...23526001R/abstract" target="_blank">AAS Winter Conference in 2020</a> in Hawaii, and we published the results in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab3625" target="_blank">MNRAS 2021</a>.

<p>
  For my Bachelor Thesis, Why We Should Kerr about the Dark Secretes of the Relativistic Accretion Disks, I implemented a general relativity photon integrator into the monte carlo radiative transfer module of Athena++ with my advisor Shane Davis. We used this ray tracer to create simulated images and spectra of supermassive balck holes and their hot accretion disks. We have compared this method with other numerical integrators and analytic solutions for given test problems, and our module reproduces the expected results. Then we can extend the code's usefulness to more interesting astrophysical scenarios, for example, by including Thomson and Compton scattering or returning radiation. This work is still in progress, and we are expecting to publish the results and this module of Athena++ soon!

<p>
My first research project analyzed the central, multi-wavelength source in Henize 2-10 postulated to be an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with Hubble Space Telescope spectra. We concluded that the spectra are consistent with both a supernova remnant and an IMBH, and I presented these results at the IAU symposia 334 in Vienna, Austria and at the AAS winter conference in 2019 in Seattle, US.
