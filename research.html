<h2 id="MWM31"> Milky Way and M31 analogues: insights from the cosmological simulation TNG50 </h2>
<h4>Doctoral Thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy with Annalisa Pillepich </h4>
<p>
  In my PhD thesis I studied key facets of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxies’ formation, evolution, and structure in the cosmological context provided by the unparalleled resolution and sample size from the state-of-the-art magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50, hightest resolution run from the IllustrisTNG suite. This simulation allows for the identification of a large number (around 200) of MW/M31-like galaxies at high resolution. Until now, studies of this type of galaxies had been carried out using zoom-in simulations that reproduced only a few analogs (at most, around a dozen).

  In this way, it was possible to shed new light on problems studied in recent years concerning the formation and evolution of the MW and M31:

    <ul>
      <li>The impact of recent major mergers on galaxy stellar disks, discovering that many of these galaxies may have experienced a recent merger and can still form a disk up to z=0.</li>
      <li>The diversity and variety of manifestations of stellar disk flaring, where it was possible to reproduce the different types and values observed in previous studies and recent observations, now under a single theoretical model of galaxy formation.</li>
      <li>The presence of very metal-poor stars in the stellar disks and other morphological components, reinforcing the idea that the halo is not necessarily the component containing the oldest stars of the MW. This finding holds extraordinary relevance in the current era of highly detailed Galactic surveys.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>On the likelihoods of finding very metal-poor (and old) stars in the Milky Way's disc, bulge, and halo</h3>
<p>
    Recent observational studies have uncovered a small number of very metal-poor (\({\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -2}\)) stars with cold kinematics in the Galactic disc and bulge. However, their origins remain enigmatic. With a sample of 138 Milky Way analogs, we limit the spatial volume coverage of stellar populations in galaxies to that targeted by the upcoming 4MOST high-resolution survey of the Galactic disc and bulge. We find that across all galaxies, \(\sim 20\) % of very metal-poor stars belong to the disk, with some analogs reaching 30 %. About \(50 \pm 10\) % of the VMP disc stars are, on average, older than \(12.5 \, \mathrm{Gyr}\) and \(\sim 70 \pm 10\) % come from accreted satellites. A large fraction of the VMP stars belong to the halo (\(\sim 70\)) and have a median age of \(12 \, \mathrm{Gyr}\). Our results with the TNG50 cosmological simulation confirm earlier findings with simulations of fewer individual galaxies, and suggest that the stellar disc of the Milky Way is very likely to host significant amounts of very- and extremely-metal-poor stars that, although mostly of ex situ origin, can also form in situ, reinforcing the idea of the existence of a primordial Galactic disc.

<h3>Disc flaring with TNG50: diversity across Milky Way and M31 analogues</h3>
<p>
  We use the sample of 198 Milky Way and Andromeda analogs from TNG50 to quantify the level of disk flaring predicted by a modern, high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulation. Disk flaring refers to the increase of vertical stellar disk height with galactocentric distance. The TNG50 galaxies are selected to have stellar disky morphology, a stellar mass in the range of \(M_* = 10^{10.5 - 11.2}~M_\odot\), and a MW-like Mpc-scale environment at \(z=0\).
  
  The stellar disks of such TNG50 MW/M31 analogs exhibit a wide diversity of structural properties, including a number of galaxies with disk scalelength and thin and thick disk scaleheights that are comparable to those measured or inferred for the Galaxy and Andromeda.
  With one set of physical ingredients, TNG50 returns a large variety of flaring flavours and amounts, also for mono-age stellar populations. With this paper, we hence propose a non-parametric characterization of flaring. The typical MW/M31 analogs exhibit disk scaleheights that are \(1.5-2\) times larger in the outer than in the inner regions of the disk for both old and young stellar populations, but with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. Which stellar population flares more, and by how much, also varies from galaxy to galaxy. TNG50 de facto brackets existing observational constraints for the Galaxy and all previous numerical findings. A link between the amount of flaring and the \(z=0\) global galaxy structural properties or merger history is complex. However, a connection between the scaleheights and the local stellar vertical kinematics and gravitational potential is clearly in place.

<h3>The merger and assembly histories of Milky Way- and M31-like galaxies with TNG50: disc survival through mergers</h3>
<p>
  We analyze the merger and assembly histories of Milky Way- and Andromeda-like galaxies to quantify how, and how often, disk galaxies of this mass can survive recent major mergers (stellar mass ratio \(\geq 1:4\)). For this, we use the cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 and identify 198 analog galaxies, selected based on their \(z=0\) stellar mass (\(10^{10.5-11.2}\, M_\odot\)), disky stellar morphology and local environment. 
  Firstly, major mergers are common: 85 % of MW/M31-like galaxies in TNG50 have undergone at least one major merger across their lifetime. In fact, 16 % galaxies have undergone a recent major merger, i.e. in the last 5 Gyr. The gas available during the merger suffices to either induce starbursts at pericentric passages or to sustain prolonged star formation after coalescence: in roughly half of the cases, the pre-existing stellar disk is destroyed because of the merger but reforms thanks to star formation. Moreover, higher merger mass ratios are more likely to destroy the stellar disks.
  In comparison to those with more ancient massive mergers, MW/M31-like galaxies with recent major mergers have, on average, somewhat thicker stellar disks, more massive and somewhat shallower stellar haloes, larger stellar ex-situ mass fractions, but similarly massive kinematically-defined bulges. All this is qualitatively consistent with the different observed properties of the Galaxy and Andromeda and with the constraints on their most recent major mergers, 8-11 and \(\sim 2\) Gyr ago, respectively.
  According to contemporary cosmological simulations, a recent quiet merger history is not a pre-requisite for obtaining a relatively-thin stellar disk at \(z=0\).

<h2 id="GAMA"> Galaxy and mass assembly (GAMA): The environmental impact on SFR and metallicity in galaxy groups </h2>

  I performed a study of the relationships and environmental dependencies between stellar mass, star formation rate, and gas metallicity for more than 700 galaxies in groups up to redshift 0.35 from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. To identify the main drivers, the sample was analysed as a function of group-centric distance, projected galaxy number density, and stellar mass. By using control samples of more than 16 000 star-forming field galaxies and volume-limited samples, we find that the highest enhancement in SFR (0.3 dex) occurs in galaxies with the lowest local density. In contrast to previous work, the data show small enhancements of ~0.1 dex in SFR for galaxies at the highest local densities or group-centric distances. The data indicates quenching in SFR only for massive galaxies, suggesting that stellar mass might be the main driver of quenching processes for star forming galaxies. We can discard a morphological driven quenching, since the Sérsic index distribution for group and control galaxies are similar. The gas metallicity does not vary drastically. It increases ~0.08 dex for galaxies at the highest local densities, and decreases for galaxies at the highest group-centric distances, in agreement with previous work. Altogether, the local density, rather than group-centric distance, shows the stronger impact in enhancing both, the SFR and gas metallicity. Applying the same methodology to galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations, the general observational trends were also in place, although the differences between group and control samples only partially agree with the observations.

<h2 id="Athena"> Study of the Infrared Luminosity Function in the Galaxy Cluster Abell 1763 </h2>

<p>
  For my master's thesis, I obtained the infrared luminosity function of the Abell 1763 cluster, extending previous analyses using a multi-photometric catalog spanning from X-rays to the infrared, based on multi-wavelength catalogs derived from publicly available data archives from ESA and NASA (Hubble Space Telescope, XMM-Newton, Chandra, Herschel, Spitzer, Gaia, etc.).  

  The luminosity function is an observable that allows the identification of certain morphological differences and stellar composition variations between cluster galaxies and field galaxies. Its infrared variant enables a more detailed study of star formation rates and their evolution with the environment and redshift.  
  
  To obtain the physical parameters of each galaxy, I performed an SED fitting using the LePhare code with theoretical and semi-empirical population synthesis templates. Through this method, I was able to derive multiple physical parameters of the cluster's galaxies, including redshift, morphological type, extinction, star formation, stellar mass, and more.
