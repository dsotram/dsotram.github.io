<h4>Doctoral Thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy with Annalisa Pillepich </h4>
<p>
In standard models of galaxy formation and evolution, there remains open-ended but highly connected questions: how does a galaxy sustain its star formation, given its limited gas mass (i.e., the fuel to form stars); how does a galaxy quench its star formation and remain quiescent for the rest of its life. These questions address the prevalence of two observationally dominant types of galaxies -- blue and star-forming, red and dead -- but how does one journey through the green valley between these two peaks? One such avenue involves the rich interplay of gas, stars, and dust between galaxies, their halos, and extragalactic space, coined the cosmic baryon cycle. Specifically, we study how smaller, satellite galaxies evolve as they enter the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of more massive hosts. Using the unparalleled resolution and sample size from the IllustrisTNG simulations, an observationally rare type of galaxy has emerged, and emerged often but only for short periods of time. These objects hurtle through the ambient, hot CGM at supersonic speeds, creating bow shocks at their fronts and long tails of stripped cold gas in their wakes. These "jellyfish" galaxies could be a missing link between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while also affecting their more massive host's ability to sustain or quench its own star formation. Hence the title of this thesis: Jellyfish Galaxies as Probes of the Cosmic Gas.

My first project invovles quantitifying when, where, and for how long ram pressure stripping -- the process that forms the jellyfish tails -- acts on TNG jellyfish galaxies. Specifically I developed a tracer particle scheme to track the gas from the interstella media (ISM) to the jellyfial tails and beyond. I've presented the preliminary results as a poster at the virtual Galaxy Clusters conference hosted by the Space Telescope Science Institute and as full talks at the

In the next steps, I will exetend these results to more massive satellites in even more massive hosts using the upcoming TNG-Cluster simulation. Additonally, I will consider all gas rather than just the cold, ISM gas of satellites. In this way, I will explore if / how Milky-Way-mass or even more massive satellites are able to retain their own CGM despite being in the dense cluster environment. This work is still ongoing, but look out for results soon!

<h4>ThinkSwiss Research Scholar Summer Project at the University of Zurich with Robert Feldmann</h4>
<p>
I spent the summer of 2018 working with Robert Feldmann and his group at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, courtesy of the ThinkSwiss research program. While there and afterwards, I studied the relationship between the sizes of low mass galaxies (M* ~ 10^7-9 Msun) measured by their stars and their halos measured by their dark matter. In the attached plot of low mass galaxies since z=5 in FIREbox, we see that the population at a given redshift has an apprxomiately linear relationship between galaxy stellar size R_1/2 and dark matter halo virial radius R_vir. However, across the populations at different redshifts, the relationship is sub-linear with power-law index alpha ~ 0.9. 
We found that the halo spin and its concentration, the former a proxy for its formation time, do not reduce the scatter in this galaxy-halo size relation (GHSR), contrary to some classical theories of galaxy formation. However, for these same galaxies, the halo spin and concentration are significant in setting the normalization of the stellar-halo mass relation (SHMR). This suggests for this sample of galaxies that the GHSR is just as or perhaps more fundamental than the SHMR. I presented these results at the

<h4>Bachelor Thesis at the University of Virginia with Shane Davis</h4>
<p>
For my Bachelor Thesis, Why We Should Kerr about the Dark Secretes of the Relativistic Accretion Disks, I implemented a general relativity photon integrator into the monte carlo radiative transfer module of Athena++ with my advisor Shane Davis. We used this ray tracer to create simulated images and spectra of supermassive balck holes and their hot accretion disks. We have compared this method with other numerical integrators and analytic solutions for given test problems, and our module reproduces the expected results. Then we can extend the code's usefulness to more interesting astrophysical scenarios, for example, by including Thomson and Compton scattering or returning radiation. This work is still in progress, and we are expecting to publish the results and this module of Athena++ soon!

<h4>VSGC Undergraduate Research Project at the University of Virginia with Mark Whittle</h4>
<p>
My first research project analyzed the central, multi-wavelength source in Henize 2-10 postulated to be an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) with Hubble Space Telescope spectra. We concluded that the spectra are consistent with both a supernova remnant and an IMBH, and I presented these results at the IAU symposia 334 in Vienna, Austria and at the AAS winter conference in 2019 in Seattle, US.

  suggest to extent BLR radius measurements to higher redshifts by applying the method of spectroastrometry to AGN.
  This technique has been used in studies of protoplanetary disks around young stellar objects and theory predicts that
  this technique is capable of directly measuring black hole masses of high-luminosity and high-redshift quasars.
  Therefore, we now study the application of this method to AGN BLRs with data obtained with the echelle spectrograph
  Gemini/GNIRS.

<h2 id="SOWAT"> Speckle Holography of dense stellar systems</h2>
<h4>SOWAT: Speckle Observations with Alleviated Turbulence</h4>
<p>
  Adaptive optics (AO) systems and image reconstruction algorithms are indispensable tools when it comes to high-resolution astrometry, especially when observations at the resolution limit of the telescope are desired.
  In this project, we analyze the potential of combining both techniques, i.e. by applying image reconstruction on AO corrected short exposures.
  For this purpose, we simulate speckle clouds with and without AO corrections in the end-to-end AO simulation tool <a href="http://frigaut.github.io/yao/index.html" target="_blank">YAO</a> (Rigaut & van Dam, 2013) and create synthetic observations, including all relevant noise contributions, using the PYTHON package <a href="https://github.com/felixbosco/vegapy" target="_blank">VEGAPy</a>.
  We reconstruct the object with the holographic imaging algorithm <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429.1367S/abstract" target="_blank">(Schödel et al. 2012, 2013)</a> to the obtained observations and find that using (partial) AO corrections enables the use of fainter holography reference stars and/or longer integration times.
  Both extent the applicability of the speckle imaging technique, fainter reference stars enable studying fainter fields and longer integration times enable the use of slower detectors.
  The results are published in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019PASP..131d4502B/abstract">F. Bosco, J-U. Pott & R. Schödel (2019), PASP, 131, 998</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we work on implementing a corresponding observing mode at the large binocular telescope (LBT, Arizona, USA),
  using the NIR imager LBT/LUCI with a new detector readout scheme.
  Furthermore, we are about to develop an integrated reduction and analysis software suite that is capable of reducing
  corresponding data and reconstructing the image with speckle holography.

<h2> High-mass star formation </h2>
<p>
  The Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) large program
  <a href="http://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/core/CORE/Overview.html" target="_blank">CORE</a> addresses open questions
  on the processes clump fragmentation and disk formation during formation of high-mass stars (> 8 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>).
  As part of the survey on twenty high-mass star-forming regions, I analyzed the star forming region IRAS 23033+5951 (or G110.0931-00.0641)
  for clump fragmentation, circumprotostellar rotation and molecular outflows.
</p>
<p>
  The observational data are from NOEMA in three configurations and the IRAM 30-m single-dish telescope at 220 GHz,
  probing the gas and dust emission at an angular resolution of ~0.44", corresponding to 1900 AU. In the mm continuum
  emission, we identify a protostellar cluster with at least 9 mm-sources,
  where three of them show a significantly higher luminosity above a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 in the uniform weighted images.
  Two of these are embedded in rotating structures and drive molecular outflows, traced in <sup>13</sup>CO (2&mdash;1) emission.
  The velocity profiles across the cores are similar to Keplerian but are missing the highest velocity components close to the center of rotation.
  Position-velocity diagrams suggest protostellar masses of ~ 9 and 20 M<sub>&#9737;</sub>.
</p>
<p>
  Rotation temperatures from fitting CH3CN (12<sub>k</sub>&mdash;11<sub>k</sub>) spectra are used for estimating the gas temperature
  and by that the disk stability against gravitational fragmentation, utilizing the Toomre Q parameter.
  Considering different disk inclination angles, we do not identify either candidate disk to be significantly unstable
  against an axisymmetric gravitational collapse.
  The three dominant sources cover different evolutionary stages within the same maternal gas clump.
  The rotational and outflow properties of the cores are similar to those found in low-mass star-forming regions
