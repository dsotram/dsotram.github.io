Hi, I'm Eric Rohr, a fellow of the International Max Planck Research School for Astronomy and Cosmic Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. I work at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in the galaxies and cosmology theory group, led by Annalisa Pillepich, and collaborate closely with Dylan Nelson's group at the Institute for Theroetical Astrophysics at Heidelberg University. Please check out the other tabs for information about my research, my CV, or me. Don't hesitate to reach out!
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in all reasearch topics related to galaxy evolution, cosmological simulations, and pretty much everyting involving numerical techniques. I specialize in analyzing outputs from the IllustrisTNG simulations, namely in following the evolution of jellyfish galaxies and their ram pressure stripped tails. But I also have experience working with the outputs from the FIREbox simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environment collaboration and in developing a general relativistic photon propagator for the monte carlo radiative transfer module in Athena++. For more information on these projects, please check out the <a href="research">RESEARCH</a> tab.

Beyond research, my bigget hobbies involing burning as many calories as possible, followed by the replenishment of those calories. Bonus points when I can combine these together. My go-to vehicles of choice are running to the tops of mountains and cycling as far away from home as possible, accompanied with the devourment of vegetarian cuisine and consumption of appropriate beverages. Since moving to Heidelberg, I've taken up learning German, also ich bin immer froh, auf Deutsch zu reden. Check out the About Me tab for more on my hobbies and me.

<p>
	I am an astrophysicist, working in the
	<a href="https://www2.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/jpott/" target="_blank">JuHeart group (J&ouml;rg-Uwe Pott)</a> at the
	<a href="http://www.mpia.de" target="_blank">Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA)</a> in Heidelberg as a
	postdoctoral researcher.
	Previously, I was a fellow of the International Max Planck Research School on Astronomy and Cosmic Physics at the
	University of Heidelberg (<a href="http://www.imprs-hd.mpg.de" target="_blank">IMPRS</a>).
</p>
<p>
	I am studying novel methods for exhausting the resolution limits of current 8m-class telescopes.
	In the <a href="../research/#SOWAT">SOWAT project</a>, we analyze the benefit of applying image reconstruction
	algorithms on imaging data, obtained with partial AO correction, to reach the diffraction limit of the telescope
	and in the <a href="../research/#SPAM">SPAM project</a> we work on high-precision spectroastrometric measurements of
	broad emission line regions (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs).
	For details you may take a look at the <a href="../research">RESEARCH</a> section.
</p>
<p>
	Besides the research, I am volunteering in the public outreach activities of the
	<a href="http://www.haus-der-astronomie.de" target="_blank">House of Astronomy (HdA)</a> as an outreach fellow.
	In this position, I guide visiting groups to the HdA planetarium and the facilities at MPIA campus on mount
	KÃ¶nigstuhl. For more outreach activities, check out the <a href="#outreach">OUTREACH</a> section.
