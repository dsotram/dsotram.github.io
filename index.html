Hello, I am Diego Sotillo Ramos, a former fellow of the International Max Planck Research School for Astronomy and Cosmic Physics in Heidelberg, Germany. Over the past four years, I worked on my PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, as part of the Galaxy Theory and Cosmology group led by Annalisa Pillepich, who also served as my supervisor. In other tabs, you can find additional information about my research, my CV, or more about me. If you wish to contact me, please do so through <a href="contact">CONTACT</a>.

I am primarily interested in topics related to galaxy evolution and magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations. During my thesis, I specialized in explaining various aspects of the formation and evolution of MW- and M31-like galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological simulation, which contains around 200 analogs of these galaxies. Some results were even surprising, such as the fact that recent major mergers do not necessarily prevent these galaxies from evolving into MW-like systems, or discovering a high number of extremely metal-poor stars forming part of the galactic disk in some cases. For a more detailed description of these and other projects, please refer to the <a href="research">RESEARCH</a> tab.

When I am not immersed in physics, I try to spend time with my family. The little energy I have left at the end of the week I enjoy spending on team sports or outdoor activities. For more information about me and my hobbies, check out the <a href="about">ABOUT</a> tab.
