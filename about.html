I am from Sanabria, one of the least densely populated regions of Spain. For this reason, the night sky is dark enough to build an astronomical observatory and have the best views. Unfortunately, the weather is not the most suitable for these purposes. But it is certainly possible that my hobby and fascination with astronomy, which later turned into astrophysics, stem from observing the Milky Way above my head from my garden at home.

Other hobbies of mine have clearly been determined by growing up in a highly nature-surrounded environment like this. Hiking, mountain biking, or sport fishing have always excited me and can be practiced at an exceptional level. Over the past year, I have also started photographing nature, especially birds. And from ancient times, I have been very fond of reading (I keep track of everything here on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23723633" target="_blank">Goodreads Diego</a>). Lately, less than I would like, much to my regret, as reading scientific articles already strains my eyes enough.

When I was young, I studied industrial engineering, specializing in mechanics and automotive. With such a background, it was almost inevitable to end up having some relationship with Germany, which has also become my second country, and its automotive industry, where I spent a few years. Meanwhile, I also studied physics, changed my course by specializing in astrophysics, and embarked on pursuing a research career by starting a PhD at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Astronomie in Heidelberg, where through cosmological simulations, I tried to decipher some enigmas about the formation and evolution of galaxies like the Milky Way and M31 (I explain this in more detail in <a href="../research">RESEARCH</a>).
